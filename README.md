# Mind-Trace

📌 Overview
The Emotion Tracker is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React to support and strengthen the relationship between a counselor and their patients.
It serves as a bridge between therapy sessions, allowing both parties to stay connected and informed about the patient’s emotional journey.

The platform has two types of users:

1. Professional

·Can log in (no account restrictions), manage an agenda and calendar, and create patient accounts.

·Follows up on patient progress outside of sessions by reviewing emotional logs.

·Can download patient logs for discussion during therapy.

·Uses these insights to improve, guide, and accelerate treatment.

2. Patient

·Only created by a professional; credentials are provided to them.

·Can log in and record daily emotional entries in a very simple way:

·Select an emoji representing their current mood.

·Optionally add a description explaining their feelings.

·Can review their emotional history and reschedule appointments within available slots.

This approach is particularly beneficial for patients dealing with anxiety, panic attacks, or other psychological issues.

It helps:

Track emotions over time.

Monitor stress levels and symptoms.

Make patients more conscious of their emotional state.

Avoid losing small but important details that could aid diagnosis.

For professionals, these logs become valuable data points that may reveal patterns, triggers, or improvements that the patient might not recall during a session.
The ability to download these logs ensures that they can be reviewed together in therapy, improving communication and making the patient feel supported even outside of sessions.
